Dubai is a must-see for all travelers alike, being that it is one of the most culturally diverse cities in the world and home to the tallest building, the largest artificial island, and the biggest mall on this planet. This article is a combination of my luxury travel dream_and_hitting Dubai on a budget.

**Welcome to the Foodie's Paradise**

With hundreds of different cuisines from low-cost to high-end, you'll be sure to find restaurants that satisfy your appetite and your wallet.

Serving every type of meat you can imagine, JW's Steakhouse is located in the JW Marriot Dubai. It has a romantic atmosphere with an extremely friendly staff, and averages about $75+ per entrée. To get your meat fix for a cheaper price, Scots American Grill is your best bet. Offering a 3 course meal for only $50, this steakhouse will not disappoint. It is located in the Marriot Al Jadaff and is very reasonably priced.

To savor the true taste of India with an unforgettable setting, try Armani Amal. Delicious food with amazing views of the Burj Khalifa, this spot averages $100 per entrée. For a less expensive meal serving all kinds of food, try Feast at the Sheraton Grand Hotel. From Indian to Italian, dishes here are about $20\.

If you're in the mood for Chinese food, Long Yin Dubai has an amazing ambience and serves some of the best Chinese in Dubai. One of their specialty dishes is duck; entrées here are $100+. For a Chinese dish at a cheaper price, Wokyo Noodle Bar serves "create-your-own" dishes at about $12 each. You can select which sauce, noodles, and protein (chicken, beef, shrimp, ect.) you would like to have.

For an elegant seafood night, Pierchic is the place to go. Serving sunset cocktails with your favorite seafood dish, you'll enjoy a lovely evening with views of the Burj Al-Arab. Dishes here are priced around $100\. For a more casual seafood experience, visit the Dubai Fish Hut. This local restaurant serves delicious fresh fish cooked to perfection, with dishes as low as $5\.

**Splurge and Stay**

The ultimate Dubai experience would have to include staying at the world's only 7-star hotel, the Burj Al Arab, located on an island with a private bridge leading up to its doors. Upon landing at the Dubai International Airport, you have 2 options of getting to your hotel. You can have a chauffeur drive you in a white Rolls Royce, or you can arrange a helicopter transfer to land on the rooftop of the hotel, which would you like? With 24-carat gold leaves covering about 22,000 square feet of decorations, the Burj Al Arab boasts a lavish, flashy interior. All 202 rooms are suites with amazing views of the Arabian Gulf. This exclusive, once in a lifetime experience will cost around $2,000 a night.

If you're not looking to splurge to that extent, the Jumeirah Dar Al Masyaf at Madinat Jumeirah offers amazing hospitality with modern, spacious rooms with 46 restaurants located in the hotel. This luxurious resort will cost around $750 a night. Another hotel around $550 a night is Atlantis the Palm, set on the iconic Palm Jumeirah island with views of the Arabian Gulf. There are 23 restaurants, a spa, a salon, and an enormous water park. In Dubai, you also have the opportunity stay at the tallest hotel in the world, the JW Marriott Marquis. This 5-star hotel is 72 floors high with an array of amenities. A suite here will cost around $450 a night.

For a more economical stay, the Ibis Dubai Al Barsha offers rooms for around $70 and is located in the heart of Dubai. Another option around the same price is the Rove Hotel, tailored towards the modern-day traveler in need of a social and cultural hub.

**Thrill or Chill**

If you're feeling adventurous, you could take a 25-minute helicopter ride over Dubai. You will see amazing views of the Palm Jumeirah, Burj Al-Arab, and the Burj Khalifa. If you're looking for a more relaxing vacation, visit the Six Senses Spa, where you can receive a healing touch massage or a radiant facial.

If you're like me, you have to visit the largest mall in the world. The Dubai mall has over 1,200 shops and includes an ice rink, SEGA Republic, KidZania, Reel Cinemas, Rainforest Café, and the Dubai Aquarium and Underwater Zoo.

In Dubai, you can also take a ride up the tallest skyscraper in the world. It costs $95 to reach the highest floor of the Burj Khalifa. If your favorite kind of adventure must include food, book a Frying Pan Adventure. Walk, taste and explore through the most food-worthy backstreets of Old Dubai, while learning about food history and culture. If you'd like to see the traditional side of Dubai, book the Half Day Tour that visits the Dubai Museum, Al Fahidi fort, and walks through the traditional souks, spice & gold markets.
