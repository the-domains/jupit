            <title><![CDATA[Caught In The Energy Waves Of Israel]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Back in March, one of our writers wrote about her ideal spiritual trip to Israel. In a serendipitous way an opportunity to visit Israel on a spiritual energy tour opened up for us this May. With a surplus of yoga and meditation retreats these days, this kind of journey seemed like a more offbeat, uncommon thing for us to partake in and therefore be able to share with our readers. This trip was unlike any other weâ€™ve been on (and one of us has done a shamanic retreat in the Peruvian Amazons). The experience is quite hard to truly put into words. We hope this post will reach your heart and/or soul, rather than your intellect, as we cover the purpose of such a trip and give you the highlights.</p>]]></description>
