In a serendipitous way an opportunity to visit Israel on a spiritual energy tour opened up for us this May. With a surplus of yoga and meditation retreats these days, this kind of journey seemed like a more offbeat, uncommon thing for us to partake in and therefore be able to share with our readers. This trip was unlike any other we’ve been on (and one of us has done a shamanic retreat in the Peruvian Amazons). The experience is quite hard to truly put into words. We hope this post will reach your heart and/or soul, rather than your intellect, as we cover the purpose of such a trip and give you the highlights.</p><p>Disclaimer: We highly respect the cultures, traditions and opposing views of the spiritual wisdom we studied - Kabbalah. We're personally not religious and this post is not meant to push any doctrine or agenda.</p><p>This trip required a very different type of preparation, a spiritual one. We were given study material on each of the sites we were going to visit and were advised to meditate on the aspects of our lives we’d like to transform. The point of the tour was to visit specific sites that are believed to be high energy points. The point is to connect with and meditate for that pure elevated energy to spread across the world, into the heart of every being. Our guides made it clear that the energy we were connecting with was not meant for us or even for our families and friends alone, but for the enlightenment of the entire world. Our meditations throughout the journey were highly focused on receiving the energy for the purpose of sharing it with others in our daily lives.</p><p>Unity amongst our group of about 30 people was highly emphasized as they key to the success of our mission. We’ve been on many tours with many different people whom we bonded with, yet this was the most profound connection with a group we’ve experienced. I am at a true loss of words when it comes to explaining exactly how our group bonded. If anything, it was a microcosm of what world peace could actually look like - idealist and seemingly impossible, I know. It was wild to take ‘world peace’ from conceptualization to manifestation during a time (and place: the Middle East itself) when the world is facing such extreme odds, violence, hatred, oppression, you name it. If such a concept ever seemed improbable to us before, we now know it is real and attainable. It became our mission to engage with people in this manner from now on.</p><blockquote><p>"Through our actions during the course of our journey, we have the power to make a change in the world and to eliminate chaos from all of humanity. We are one group with a collective consciousness; and as a group we can influence more than we can by ourselves." - Taken directly from our study material.</p></blockquote><p>The tour began in the small, quaint town of Tzfat (Safed) where many Kabbalist sages moved to some 500 years ago after the expulsion of Jews from Spain in 1492. The town itself is so cute I could barely handle it. The weather was absolutely divine at about 60 degrees fahrenheit with sun all day dipping a few degrees lower after the sun would set. One of the main features of Tzfat is the Old Town where you’ll find the Artists’ Colony, medieval synagogues, and Old Jewish Quarter with private and guest homes. The cobblestone alley ways and narrow streets provide that typical old city feeling. Tzfat is 3000 ft above sea level making it the most elevated city in Israel. Here, we visited many sites including the Mikveh - pool of living waters - of Rav Isaac Luria, one of the most notable sages, and one of the synagogues of Rav Luria.</p><picture>

<p>In Tzfat, and every other town we went to, we visited the gravesites of certain sages. Whoa.. gravesites?! You may ask. Yes, and we understand your confusion/skepticism/weirdedoutness. Stay with us here. Kabbalists visit the gravesites of certain sages because they were able to reach extremely high levels of spirituality (think Buddha). Therefore, making a connection with them where they physically lay is a way to channel their enormous positive energy in the world.</p><p>We won’t go into detail about each sage we visited in this article, but there were many spread out in the 7 days of the tour. We’d like to add that this experience never felt creepy. These sites are all adorned and taken care of. Many of them are quite beautiful and all were peaceful to be in.</p><picture>

<p>Other than sages, we went to the Cave of Pekiin, where Rabbi Shimon and his son for 13 years around 200 years ago. Interestingly, 13 numerically is the power to go beyond our nature, love, oneness and care. It is said the two spent this time in fervent study and meditation to reveal deeper levels wisdom than ever before. Though the cave is easily accessible today it was originally isolated from the rest of society. They survived by the miracle of a carob tree sprouting and a stream flowing next to the cave for food and water.</p><p>Next was a day trip to Tiberias where we spent a few hours at Bora Bora Beach Bar, where we lounged, enjoyed great conversations, drinks and the beach! It was a welcomed change of pace from constant meditation. Bora Bora had a large bar, ample lounging space with beach chairs and umbrellas, hot showers, changing rooms, and large floating loungers to use in the water. Of course, even this leisure time had a twinge of spirituality tied in as we all participated in a mikveh in the Sea of Galilee. The purpose of the mikveh is to purify the layers of negativity within and around ourselves created by our own reactive and negative actions. The purification itself is quick and simple. First you do short meditations before immersing yourself in water ‘x’ amount of times, we did 14.</p><p>What is interesting about Tiberias is that this city was visited by tourists even two millennia ago. Wealthy Romans used it as a spa. It is located on the western side of the Sea of Galilee. Historians agree that this city plays one of the most important roles in Israeli history. The ancient High Court of Israel, for example, was moved from Sepphoris to Tiberias. In the so-called Talmudic period of Jewish history, Tiberias was a very important spiritual and religious center. The authoritative collection of exegetical materials that resemble the verbal tradition of Jewish law known as the Mishnah was created in Tiberias. This is actually the first part of the Talmud. The famous Jewish sage Maimonides (1204) rests in Tiberius as well as Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai and Rabbi Akiva. The Crusaders named Tiberias the capital city of the province of Galilee, but it didn’t take much time before Saladin re-conquered this important city.</p><picture>

<p>We then traveled about to Acre for a more 'secular style’ guided tour. Acre, also known as Akko, is one of the oldest cities in the world and one of the rare cities in this part of the world that has been inhabited continuously for more than 3500 years. Even though Acre is not a very big city today, in the past it was one of the main ports in Israel and Mediterranean. This was a very important port for Israel because it served as a trading post too which improved Israeli economy. This is the reason why many foreign conquerors like Alexander the Great, the army of the Muslims which was part of the Muslim conquest and the army of Crusaders paid special attention to this port city. Acre was part of the Ottoman Empire for many years and this is the reason why one of the biggest and most attractive mosques known as the Al-Jazeera mosque can be found in Acre. It is worth mentioning that even Napoleon tried to take over Acre from the Ottomans in 1799, but he didn’t make it. After the end of the War of Independence, Acre became part of modern Israel. Acre also has a religious significance too because this city was the home of Baha Allah, the founder of the Baha’I faith. The tomb today is located close to the town and it features some amazing gardens which attract thousands of people every year - unfortunately, we weren’t able to visit.</p><picture>

<p>We spent an afternoon at Adir Winery for lunch and wine tasting. Adir also produces its own goat diary products to pair with the wines. To start, we were served a variety of goat cheeses and yogurts, two different white wines and a red wine with lunch. We ate fish, vegetables, salad (need to see pictures of everything to remember). Everything was deliciously fulfilling, especially the cheeses. The back porch and garden area was the perfect spot to hang out and let the food and wine settle.</p><picture>
